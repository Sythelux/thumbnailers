# Thumbnailer

This repo is a collection of thumbnailers and scripts to get specific thumbnails to work.

# Install

there is a makefile so you can use `sudo make install` it will copy the thumbnailers and the bin scripts into the corresponding folders you can copy single scripts manually

some thumbnailers might already exists on some package. the make install command will not overwrite them.

# TODO

- Folder script is not very performant
- PureRef scripts opens up a window of the application -> needs a headless mode

Example on how the Folder thumbnailer looks:
