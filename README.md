# Thumbnailer

This repo is a collection of thumbnailers and scripts to get specific thumbnails to work.

the folder "thumbnailers" has to be put as /usr/share/thumbnailers
the the content from bin has to be put into a bin path lice /usr/local/bin/

some thumbnailers might already exists on some package

# TODO

installer scripts would be cool
